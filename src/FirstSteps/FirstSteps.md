## Variables

- **A keyword** is any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the Java language.
- **Variables** are a way to store information in our computer. Variables that we define in a program, can be accessed by a name we give them, and the computer does the hard work, of figuring out where they get stored, in the computer's random access memory, or RAM.
- **A declaration statement** is used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, then optionally to set the variable to a specific value.
- **An expression** is a coding construct, that evaluates to a single value.
- Java **operators**, or just operators, perform an operation (hence the term) on a variable or value.
